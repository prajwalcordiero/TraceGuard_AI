"""
Controls the Android emulator lifecycle for dynamic APK analysis:
boot with traffic capture enabled, install the sample, launch it,
let it run, then shut down and hand back the pcap.

Prerequisites (one-time, see README.md):
  - Android SDK installed, with `emulator` and `adb` on your PATH
  - An AVD already created, e.g. named "dynamic-analysis"
